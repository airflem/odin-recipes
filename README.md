# odin-recipes

This project is part of [The Odin Project Foundations Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It showcases the fundamentals of HTML5 by creating a simple recipe website.

## Project Overview

The website consists of four web pages:
- A main index page with links to individual recipe pages.
- Recipe pages that include:
  - Unordered and ordered lists for ingredients and steps.
  - External images with controlled dimensions.
  - Links to both internal pages and external resources.

## Skills Demonstrated

Through this project, I:
- Built structured web pages using HTML5 elements.
- Implemented hyperlinks for seamless navigation between pages.
- Created organized lists (ordered and unordered) to present information.
- Linked and styled external images with specified height attributes.

## Reflection

Completing this project helped me understand the building blocks of HTML5 and how to structure content effectively. It was a great introduction to creating functional and visually organized web pages.
