    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 jar (28 ounces) spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 container (15 ounces) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (or 2 teaspoons dried)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Noodles:</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and lay them flat on a parchment-lined baking sheet to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Meat Sauce:</strong> In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until browned. Season with salt and pepper. Drain any excess fat. Stir in the spaghetti sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Cheese Mixture:</strong> In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and parsley. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble Lasagna:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Place three lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of meat sauce on top of the cheese mixture.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles and the remaining meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes until the cheese is melted and slightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong> Allow the lasagna to rest for about 15 minutes before slicing. This helps it set and makes serving easier.</li>
    </ol>
